## Introduction

![](img/index.jpg) 

This project combines **YOLOv2**([reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640)) and **seq-nms**([reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08465)) to realise **real time video detection**.
This tutorial is designed for Linux with Anaconda.

## Steps

1) Open a terminal in the folder where you are going to work.
2) Clone the repository and go to the seq_nm folder:

`$ git clone `

`$ cd seq_nms`

## Reference

This project copies lots of code from [darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) , [Seq-NMS](https://github.com/lrghust/Seq-NMS) and  [models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models).
